# Brain-games
Brain Games is a set of five console arithmetics games.
Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered to be completed. Wrong answers end the game and offer to play it again.

Games:
+ Brain-even - determining an even number.
+ Brain-calc - arithmetic expressions to be calculated.
+ Brain-gcd - determining the largest common divisor.
+ Brain-progression - finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
+ Brain-prime - determining a prime number.
## Installation
The game can only be run on a Unix-like operating system.
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed run the following commands:
```shell
node -v
npm -v 
```
Node.js `v13.0.0` or higher must be installed to run the game.

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/EgorovArtem34/frontend-project-lvl1.git`
2. Go to repository directory `cd frontend-project-lvl1`
3. install dependencies `make install`
4. install the package `make link`
5. Each game has its own command to run. Choose your game and run one of the following commands: `brain-even`, `brain-calc`, `brain-gcd`, `brain-progression` or `brain-prime`
